# Project Description
This project utilizes iris recognition that detect and classify the iris images through the use of computer vision and machine learning. The computer vision program detects the iris and isolates it from the original image of the eye. These iris images will then be used to train and test various machine learning models. We will utilize many machine learning algorithms to determine which will be the best for the iris detection. We will also attempt speed optimizations on these models. Finally, we will conduct an analysis on the data and use the results to answer various questions about the data.
